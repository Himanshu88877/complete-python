# How I wonder what you are!
# Up above the world so high,
# Like a diamond in the sky.

# When the blazing sun is gone,
# When he nothing shines upon,
# Then you show your little light,
# Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.

# Then the trav'ller in the dark,
# Thanks you for your tiny spark,
# He could not see which way to go,
# If you did not twinkle so.

# In the dark blue sky you keep,
# And often thro' my curtains peep,
# For you never shut your eye,
# Till the sun is in the sky.

# 'Tis your bright and tiny spark,
# Lights the trav'ller in the dark:
# Tho' I know not what you are,
# Twinkle, twinkle, little star.''')
